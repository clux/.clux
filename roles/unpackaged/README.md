# unpackaged installs
All the stuff that is not controlled uniformly by package managers.

Key installs:

- sublime text 3
- nodejs LTS (because non-LTS breaks my modules)
- z
- blackbox
- arcanist
- bats

Obviously node and sublime are going to have dynamic link dependencies.
These roles playbooks are in no way universal and should not be used unless you know what you're doing.
